# FIM

The Foundation Inference Model (FIM) library offers a streamlined implementation of the FIM methodology, including models, training procedures, and example inference scripts. Built on PyTorch, the library simplifies the process of training and evaluating FIMs.
Instead of writing models and training routines from scratch, users can define configurations in a simple .yaml file, enabling quick experimentation to tackle complex problems.
The library originates from the [FIM series of papers](intro.md#Publications). Pretrained models that replicate the results from these publications are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/FIM4Science).
